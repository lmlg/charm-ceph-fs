# CephFS Charm

# Overview

Ceph is a distributed storage and network file system designed to provide
excellent performance, reliability, and scalability.

This charm deploys a Ceph MDS cluster.

Usage
=====

Boot things up by using:

    juju deploy -n 3 ceph-mon
    juju deploy -n 3 ceph-osd

In my example deployments on EC2 the following ceph.yaml will work:

You can then deploy this charm by simply doing:

    juju deploy ceph-fs
    juju add-relation ceph-fs ceph-mon

Once the ceph-mon and osd charms have bootstrapped the cluster, the ceph-mon
charm will notify the ceph-fs charm.
