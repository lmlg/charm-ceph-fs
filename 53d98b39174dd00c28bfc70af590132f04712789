We should probably add a comment in the code about that for people like me :) Chris, while you\u0027re here can you shed any light on why we\u0027re setting osd-devices\u003d\u0027/srv/ceph /dev/test-non-existent\u0027 (re: Ryan\u0027s comment)? I think we are ok since we\u0027re using storage via \u0027osd-devices: cinder,10G\u0027 but not sure what the point of setting the osd-devices paths is.",
